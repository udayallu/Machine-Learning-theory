# Regression

1. Regression Analysis is a statistical tool used to determine the relationship between the 2 differnet types of the variables.
2. It hleps us to analysie how the changes made in one variable effects the behaviour of the another variable.
3. Here we will find the dependednt and the independent variables.

### Regression Analysis is classfied into two types 
1. Linear Regression
2. Non Linear regression 

### Linear Regression is classfied in to 2 types
1. Simple linear regression
2. Multiple Linear Regression

## Simple Linear Regression

1. Simple regression enables us to find the relationship between the continus dependednt varaiable Y and a continus independednt varaible X.
2. Mathematically, we can write this linear relationship as **Y ≈ β0 + β1X**.

You might read “≈” as “is approximately modeled as”. We will sometimes
describe (3.1) by saying that we are regressing Y on X (or Y onto X).
For example, X may represent TV advertising and Y may represent sales.
- Then we can regress sales onto TV by fitting the model **sales ≈ β0 + β1 × TV**.
- β0 and β1 are two unknown constants that represent the intercept and slope terms in the linear model. Together, β0 and β1 are intercept slope known as the model coefficients or parameters.

Once we have used our training data to produce estimates ˆ β0 and ˆβ1 for the model coefficients, we can predict future sales on the basis of a particular value of TV advertising by computing **y = ˆ β0 + ˆ β1x**

where **ˆy** indicates a prediction of Y on the basis of X = x. Here we use a hat symbol, **ˆ** , to denote the estimated value for an unknown parameter or coefficient, or to denote the predicted value of the response.
